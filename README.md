**`Digital Craftsman (Developer/Student/Enthusiast)`**

Welcome to my Github! I am a fourth year software engineering student at the University of Alberta in 🇨🇦! All my projects are made with two things in mind: creative exploration and professional development. I'm particularily interested in Machine Learning and Robotics!
